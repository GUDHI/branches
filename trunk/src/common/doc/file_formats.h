 \section FileFormatsPers Persistence Diagram

 Such a file, whose extension is usually `.pers`, contains a list of persistence intervals.<br>
 Lines starting with `#` are ignored (comments).<br>
 Other lines might contain 2, 3 or 4 values (the number of values on each line must be the same for all lines):
 \verbatim
   [[field] dimension] birth death
 \endverbatim

 Here is a simple sample file:
 \verbatim
   # Persistence diagram example
   2 2.7 3.7
   2 9.6 14.
   # Some comments
   3 34.2 34.974
   4 3. inf
 \endverbatim

 Other sample files can be found in the `data/persistence_diagram` folder.

 Such files can be generated with `Gudhi::persistent_cohomology::Persistent_cohomology::output_diagram()` and read with
 `Gudhi::read_persistence_intervals_and_dimension()`, `Gudhi::read_persistence_intervals_grouped_by_dimension()` or
 `Gudhi::read_persistence_intervals_in_dimension()`.
