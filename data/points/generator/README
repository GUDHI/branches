=========================== C++ generators =====================================

To build the C++ generators, run in a Terminal:

cd /path-to-gudhi/
cmake .
cd /path-to-data-generator/
make

======================= data_points_generator ==================================

Example of use :

*** Hyper sphere|cube generator

./data_points_generator on sphere onSphere.off 1000 3 15.2

 => generates a onSphere.off file with 1000 points randomized on a sphere of dimension 3 and radius 15.2

./data_points_generator in sphere inSphere.off 100 2

 => generates a inSphere.off file with 100 points randomized in a sphere of dimension 2 (circle) and radius 1.0 (default)

./data_points_generator in cube inCube.off 10000 3 5.8

 => generates a inCube.off file with 10000 points randomized in a cube of dimension 3 and side 5.8

!! Warning: hypegenerator on cube is not available !!

===================== aurelien_alvarez_surfaces_in_R8 ==========================

This generator is written in Python.

This code generates points on a family of surfaces living in CP^2. You can move
in the family thanks to the parameter "degre". The parameter "nombrePoints"
allows to choose the number of points on the chosen surface. Finally, to compute
the points, we choose a chart in C^2 and take points randomly in the x-variable,
so that you may also modify the window for x in the complex plane (parameter
"module_x").

After that, the program computes points in C^2, then maps them in R^8, so that
the points live on a surface which is compact (which is not the case for the
intersection of the surface with C^2). We end off with a bunch of points on a
compact surface in R^8.
