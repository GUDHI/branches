  Computation of persistent cohomology using the algorithm of 
  \cite DBLP:journals/dcg/SilvaMV11 and \cite DBLP:journals/corr/abs-1208-5018 
  and the Compressed Annotation Matrix 
  implementation of \cite DBLP:conf/esa/BoissonnatDM13 
       
  The theory of homology consists in attaching to a topological space a sequence of 
  (homology) groups, 
  capturing global topological features 
  like connected components, holes, cavities, etc. Persistent homology studies the evolution 
  -- birth, life and death -- of 
  these features when the topological space is changing. Consequently, the theory is essentially 
  composed of three elements: 
  topological spaces, their homology groups and an evolution scheme.

 \section persistencetopolocalspaces Topological Spaces
 Topological spaces are represented by simplicial complexes.
 Let \f$V = \{1, \cdots ,|V|\}\f$ be a set of <EM>vertices</EM>.
 A <EM>simplex</EM> \f$\sigma\f$ is a subset of vertices
 \f$\sigma \subseteq V\f$. A <EM>simplicial complex</EM> \f$\mathbf{K}\f$
 on \f$V\f$ is a collection of simplices \f$\{\sigma\}\f$,
 \f$\sigma \subseteq V\f$, such that \f$\tau \subseteq \sigma \in \mathbf{K}
 \Rightarrow \tau \in \mathbf{K}\f$. The dimension \f$n=|\sigma|-1\f$ of \f$\sigma\f$
 is its number of elements minus 1. A <EM>filtration</EM> of a simplicial complex is
 a function \f$f:\mathbf{K} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}\f$ satisfying \f$f(\tau)\leq
 f(\sigma)\f$ whenever \f$\tau \subseteq \sigma\f$.

 We define the concept FilteredComplex which enumerates the requirements for a class
 to represent a filtered complex from which persistent homology may be computed.
 We use the vocabulary of simplicial complexes, but the concept
 is valid for any type of cell complex. The main requirements
 are the definition of:
 \li type <CODE>Indexing_tag</CODE>, which is a model of the concept
 <CODE>IndexingTag</CODE>,
 describing the nature of the indexing scheme,
 \li type Simplex_handle to manipulate simplices,
 \li method <CODE>int dimension(Simplex_handle)</CODE> returning
 the dimension of a simplex,
 \li type and method <CODE>Boundary_simplex_range
 boundary_simplex_range(Simplex_handle)</CODE> that returns
 a range giving access to the codimension 1 subsimplices of the
 input simplex, as-well-as the coefficients \f$(-1)^i\f$ in the
 definition of the operator \f$\partial\f$. The iterators have
 value type <CODE>Simplex_handle</CODE>,
 \li type and method
 <CODE>Filtration_simplex_range filtration_simplex_range ()</CODE>
 that returns a range giving
 access to all the simplices of the complex read in the order
 assigned by the indexing scheme,
 \li type and method
 <CODE>Filtration_value filtration (Simplex_handle)</CODE> that returns the value of
 the filtration on the simplex represented by the handle.

 \section persistencehomology Homology
 For a ring \f$\mathcal{R}\f$, the group of <EM>n-chains</EM>,
 denoted \f$\mathbf{C}_n(\mathbf{K},\mathcal{R})\f$, of \f$\mathbf{K}\f$ is the
 group of formal sums of
 n-simplices with \f$\mathcal{R}\f$ coefficients. The <EM>boundary operator</EM> is a
 linear operator
 \f$\partial_n: \mathbf{C}_n(\mathbf{K},\mathcal{R}) \rightarrow \mathbf{C}_{n-1}(\mathbf{K},\mathcal{R})\f$
 such that \f$\partial_n \sigma = \partial_n [v_0, \cdots , v_n] =
 \sum_{i=0}^n (-1)^{i}[v_0,\cdots ,\widehat{v_i}, \cdots,v_n]\f$,
 where \f$\widehat{v_i}\f$ means \f$v_i\f$ is omitted from the list. The chain
 groups form a sequence:

 \f[\cdots \ \ \mathbf{C}_n(\mathbf{K},\mathcal{R}) \xrightarrow{\ \partial_n\ } \mathbf{C}_{n-1}(\mathbf{K},\mathcal{R})
 \xrightarrow{\partial_{n-1}} \cdots \xrightarrow{\ \partial_2 \ }
 \mathbf{C}_1(\mathbf{K},\mathcal{R}) \xrightarrow{\ \partial_1 \ }  \mathbf{C}_0(\mathbf{K},\mathcal{R}) \f]

 of finitely many groups \f$\mathbf{C}_n(\mathbf{K},\mathcal{R})\f$ and homomorphisms
 \f$\partial_n\f$, indexed by the dimension \f$n \geq 0\f$.
 The boundary operators satisfy the property \f$\partial_n \circ \partial_{n+1}=0\f$
 for every \f$n > 0\f$
 and we define the homology groups:

 \f[\mathbf{H}_n(\mathbf{K},\mathcal{R}) = \ker \partial_n / \mathrm{im} \  \partial_{n+1}\f]

 We refer to \cite Munkres-elementsalgtop1984 for an introduction to homology
 theory and to \cite DBLP:books/daglib/0025666 for an introduction to persistent homology.

 \section persistenceindexingscheme Indexing Scheme
 "Changing" a simplicial complex consists in applying a simplicial map.
 An <EM>indexing scheme</EM> is a directed graph together with a traversal
 order, such that two
 consecutive nodes in the graph are connected by an arrow (either forward or backward).
 The nodes represent simplicial complexes and the directed edges simplicial maps.

 From the computational point of view, there are two types of indexing schemes of
 interest
 in persistent homology: <EM>linear</EM> ones
 \f$\bullet \longrightarrow \bullet \longrightarrow \cdots \longrightarrow \bullet
 \longrightarrow \bullet\f$
 in persistent homology \cite DBLP:journals/dcg/ZomorodianC05 ,
 and <EM>zigzag</EM> ones
 \f$\bullet \longrightarrow \bullet \longleftarrow \cdots
 \longrightarrow \bullet
 \longleftarrow \bullet \f$ in zigzag persistent
 homology \cite DBLP:journals/focm/CarlssonS10.
 These indexing schemes have a natural left-to-right traversal order, and we
 describe them with ranges and iterators.
 In the current release of the Gudhi library, only the linear case is implemented.

 In the following, we consider the case where the indexing scheme is induced
 by a filtration.
 Ordering the simplices
 by increasing filtration values (breaking ties so as a simplex appears after
 its subsimplices of same filtration value) provides an indexing scheme.
