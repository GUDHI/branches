 * The bottleneck distance measures the similarity between two persistence diagrams. It's the shortest distance b for which there exists a perfect matching between
 * the points of the two diagrams (completed with all the points on the diagonal in order to ignore cardinality mismatchs) such that
 * any couple of matched points are at distance at most b.
 *
 * \image html perturb_pd.png On this picture, the red edges represent the matching. The bottleneck distance is the length of the longest edge.
