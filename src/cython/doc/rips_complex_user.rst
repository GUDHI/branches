`Rips complex <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietoris%E2%80%93Rips_complex>`_ is a one skeleton graph that allows to
construct a simplicial complex from it. The input can be a point cloud with a given distance function, or a distance
matrix.

The filtration value of each edge is computed from a user-given distance function, or directly from the distance
matrix.

All edges that have a filtration value strictly greater than a given threshold value are not inserted into the complex.

When creating a simplicial complex from this one skeleton graph, Rips inserts the one skeleton graph into the data
structure, and then expands the simplicial complex when required.

Vertex name correspond to the index of the point in the given range (aka. the point cloud).

    Rips-complex one skeleton graph representation

On this example, as edges (4,5), (4,6) and (5,6) are in the complex, simplex (4,5,6) is added with the filtration value
set with :math:`max(filtration(4,5), filtration(4,6), filtration(5,6))`. And so on for simplex (0,1,2,3).

If the Rips_complex interfaces are not detailed enough for your need, please refer to rips_persistence_step_by_step.cpp
example, where the graph construction over the Simplex_tree is more detailed.

Point cloud
-----------

Example from a point cloud
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This example builds the one skeleton graph from the given points, and max_edge_length value.
Then it creates a :doc:`Simplex_tree <simplex_tree_ref>` with it.

Finally, it is asked to display information about the simplicial complex.

.. testcode::

    import gudhi
    rips_complex = gudhi.RipsComplex(points=[[1, 1], [7, 0], [4, 6], [9, 6], [0, 14], [2, 19], [9, 17]],
        max_edge_length=12.0)

    simplex_tree = rips_complex.create_simplex_tree(max_dimension=1)
    result_str = 'Rips complex is of dimension ' + repr(simplex_tree.dimension()) + ' - ' + \
        repr(simplex_tree.num_simplices()) + ' simplices - ' + \
        repr(simplex_tree.num_vertices()) + ' vertices.'
    print(result_str)
    fmt = '%s -> %.2f'
    for filtered_value in simplex_tree.get_filtration():
        print(fmt % tuple(filtered_value))

When launching (Rips maximal distance between 2 points is 12.0, is expanded
until dimension 1 - one skeleton graph in other words), the output is:

.. testoutput::

    Rips complex is of dimension 1 - 18 simplices - 7 vertices.
    [0] -> 0.00
    [1] -> 0.00
    [2] -> 0.00
    [3] -> 0.00
    [4] -> 0.00
    [5] -> 0.00
    [6] -> 0.00
    [2, 3] -> 5.00
    [4, 5] -> 5.39
    [0, 2] -> 5.83
    [0, 1] -> 6.08
    [1, 3] -> 6.32
    [1, 2] -> 6.71
    [5, 6] -> 7.28
    [2, 4] -> 8.94
    [0, 3] -> 9.43
    [4, 6] -> 9.49
    [3, 6] -> 11.00

Example from OFF file
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This example builds the :doc:`Rips_complex <rips_complex_ref>` from the given
points in an OFF file, and max_edge_length value.
Then it creates a :doc:`Simplex_tree <simplex_tree_ref>` with it.

Finally, it is asked to display information about the Rips complex.


.. testcode::

    import gudhi
    point_cloud = gudhi.read_off(off_file=gudhi.__root_source_dir__ + '/data/points/alphacomplexdoc.off')
    rips_complex = gudhi.RipsComplex(points=point_cloud, max_edge_length=12.0)
    simplex_tree = rips_complex.create_simplex_tree(max_dimension=1)
    result_str = 'Rips complex is of dimension ' + repr(simplex_tree.dimension()) + ' - ' + \
        repr(simplex_tree.num_simplices()) + ' simplices - ' + \
        repr(simplex_tree.num_vertices()) + ' vertices.'
    print(result_str)
    fmt = '%s -> %.2f'
    for filtered_value in simplex_tree.get_filtration():
        print(fmt % tuple(filtered_value))

the program output is:

.. testoutput::

    Rips complex is of dimension 1 - 18 simplices - 7 vertices.
    [0] -> 0.00
    [1] -> 0.00
    [2] -> 0.00
    [3] -> 0.00
    [4] -> 0.00
    [5] -> 0.00
    [6] -> 0.00
    [2, 3] -> 5.00
    [4, 5] -> 5.39
    [0, 2] -> 5.83
    [0, 1] -> 6.08
    [1, 3] -> 6.32
    [1, 2] -> 6.71
    [5, 6] -> 7.28
    [2, 4] -> 8.94
    [0, 3] -> 9.43
    [4, 6] -> 9.49
    [3, 6] -> 11.00

Distance matrix
---------------

Example from a distance matrix
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This example builds the one skeleton graph from the given distance matrix, and max_edge_length value.
Then it creates a :doc:`Simplex_tree <simplex_tree_ref>` with it.

Finally, it is asked to display information about the simplicial complex.

                                     max_edge_length=12.0)

    simplex_tree = rips_complex.create_simplex_tree(max_dimension=1)

Then it creates a :doc:`Simplex_tree <simplex_tree_ref>` with it.

Finally, it is asked to display information about the Rips complex.


.. testcode::

    import gudhi
    distance_matrix = gudhi.read_lower_triangular_matrix_from_csv_file(csv_file=gudhi.__root_source_dir__ + \
        '/data/distance_matrix/full_square_distance_matrix.csv')
    rips_complex = gudhi.RipsComplex(distance_matrix=distance_matrix, max_edge_length=12.0)
    simplex_tree = rips_complex.create_simplex_tree(max_dimension=1)

    [0, 3] -> 9.43
    [4, 6] -> 9.49
    [3, 6] -> 11.00

Correlation matrix
------------------

Example from  a correlation matrix
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Analogously to the case of distance matrix, Rips complexes can be also constructed based on correlation matrix.
Given a correlation matrix M, comportment-wise 1-M is a distance matrix.
This example builds the one skeleton graph from the given corelation matrix and threshold value.
Then it creates a :doc:`Simplex_tree <simplex_tree_ref>` with it.

Finally, it is asked to display information about the simplicial complex.

.. testcode::

    import gudhi
    import numpy as np

    # User defined correlation matrix is:
    # |1     0.06    0.23    0.01    0.89|
    # |0.06  1       0.74    0.01    0.61|
    # |0.23  0.74    1       0.72    0.03|
    # |0.01  0.01    0.72    1       0.7 |
    # |0.89  0.61    0.03    0.7     1   |
    correlation_matrix=np.array([[1., 0.06, 0.23, 0.01, 0.89],
                                [0.06, 1., 0.74, 0.01, 0.61],
                                [0.23, 0.74, 1., 0.72, 0.03],
                                [0.01, 0.01, 0.72, 1., 0.7],
                                [0.89, 0.61, 0.03, 0.7, 1.]], float)

    distance_matrix = np.ones((correlation_matrix.shape),float) - correlation_matrix
    rips_complex = gudhi.RipsComplex(distance_matrix=distance_matrix, max_edge_length=1.0)

    simplex_tree = rips_complex.create_simplex_tree(max_dimension=1)
    result_str = 'Rips complex is of dimension ' + repr(simplex_tree.dimension()) + ' - ' + \
        repr(simplex_tree.num_simplices()) + ' simplices - ' + \
        repr(simplex_tree.num_vertices()) + ' vertices.'
    print(result_str)
    fmt = '%s -> %.2f'
    for filtered_value in simplex_tree.get_filtration():
        print(fmt % tuple(filtered_value))

When launching (Rips maximal distance between 2 points is 12.0, is expanded
until dimension 1 - one skeleton graph in other words), the output is:

.. testoutput::

    Rips complex is of dimension 1 - 15 simplices - 5 vertices.
    [0] -> 0.00
    [1] -> 0.00
    [2] -> 0.00
    [3] -> 0.00
    [4] -> 0.00
    [0, 4] -> 0.11
    [1, 2] -> 0.26
    [2, 3] -> 0.28
    [3, 4] -> 0.30
    [1, 4] -> 0.39
    [0, 2] -> 0.77
    [0, 1] -> 0.94
    [2, 4] -> 0.97
    [0, 3] -> 0.99
    [1, 3] -> 0.99

.. note::
    As persistence diagrams points will be under the diagonal,
    bottleneck distance and persistence graphical tool will not work properly,
    this is a known issue.
