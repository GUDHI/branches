/**
 * Universal procedure to read files with persistence. It ignores the lines starting from # (treat them as comments). 
 * It reads the first line which is not a comment and assume that there are some numerical entries over there. The program assume
 * that each other line in the file, which is not a comment, have the same number of numerical entries (2, 3 or 4). 
 * If there are two numerical entries per line, then the function assume that they are birth/death coordinates. 
 * If there are three numerical entries per line, then the function assume that they are: dimension and birth/death coordinates. 
 * If there are four numerical entries per line, then the function assume that they are: the characteristic of a filed over which 
 * persistence was computed, dimension and birth/death coordinates. 
 * The 'inf' string can appear only as a last element of a line. 
 * The procedure returns vector of persistence pairs.
