Example of use :

*** Simplex tree construction with Z/2Z coefficients on points sampling a Klein bottle:

./simplex_tree_from_file ../../../data/points/Klein_bottle_complex.txt 2
Insert the 1-skeleton in the simplex tree in 0 s. 
Expand the simplex tree in 0 s. 
Information of the Simplex Tree: 
  Number of vertices = 10   Number of simplices = 82

with Z/3Z coefficients:

./simplex_tree_from_file ../../../data/points/Klein_bottle_complex.txt 3

Insert the 1-skeleton in the simplex tree in 0 s.
Expand the simplex tree in 0 s.
Information of the Simplex Tree:
  Number of vertices = 10   Number of simplices = 106

*** Simplex_tree computed from a Alpha-shapes 3:

./simplex_tree_from_alpha_shapes_3 ../../../data/points/bunny_5000
