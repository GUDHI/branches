  * \class Spatial_tree_data_structure Spatial_tree_data_structure.h gudhi/Spatial_tree_data_structure.h
  * \brief Spatial tree data structure to perform (approximate) nearest neighbor search.
  *
  * \ingroup spatial_searching
  *
  * \details
  * The class Spatial_tree_data_structure is a tree-based data structure, based on
  * <a target="_blank" href="http://doc.cgal.org/latest/Spatial_searching/index.html">CGAL dD spatial searching data structures</a>.
  * It provides a simplified API to perform (approximate) nearest neighbor searches. Contrary to CGAL default behavior, the tree
  * does not store the points themselves, but stores indices.
  *
  * There are two types of queries: the <i>k-nearest neighbor query</i>, where <i>k</i> is fixed and the <i>k</i> nearest points are 
  * computed right away,
  * and the <i>incremental nearest neighbor query</i>, where no number of neighbors is provided during the call, as the
  * neighbors will be computed incrementally when the iterator on the range is incremented.
  *
  * \tparam K must be a model of the <a target="_blank"
  *   href="http://doc.cgal.org/latest/Spatial_searching/classSearchTraits.html">SearchTraits</a>
  *   concept, such as the <a target="_blank"
  *   href="http://doc.cgal.org/latest/Kernel_d/classCGAL_1_1Epick__d.html">CGAL::Epick_d</a> class, which
  *   can be static if you know the ambiant dimension at compile-time, or dynamic if you don't.
  * \tparam Point_container_ is the type of the container where points are stored (on the user side).
  *   It must provide random-access via `operator[]` and the points should be stored contiguously in memory.
  *   `std::vector` is a good candidate.
