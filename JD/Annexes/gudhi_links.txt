"Beyond random graphs : random simplicial complexes. Applications to sensor networks" 
Seems to encompass dimensions beyond 3, but I'm not sure (existence of a tetrahedron in Rips cplx means over-coverage, yet on slide ~61 we are looking at the 5th Betti number.

"Combinatorial Connectivities in Social Systems: An Application of Simplicial Complex Structures"
Title is promising ...  but it is published in 1977, and I can't find out anything about the book or the author, Ron Atkin. Oh wait ...:

math.la.asu.edu/~helene/papers/blFPSAC-20-02-04.pdf
"Perspectives on A-homotopy theory and its applications"
Talks about Ron Atkin's book and his 'Q-analysis'. 
I don't know what to make of this stuff.

"Multidimensional events in multilevel systems" by Jeffrey Johnson
in
"The dynamics of complex urbans systems"
continuing on the Ron Atkin thread.
This is not a very mathy paper, but it shows that these guys are at least in principle interseted in higher dimensional simplicial complexes. It is worth skimming through and reading at least the abstract and the sales pitch for Atkin at the end (in Acknowledgement).

Linked from the spartan Wikipedia page on Q-analysis, this paper is social science gobbledygook; it could almost be one of those automatically generated papers. Anyway, it seems to attempt to critique the application of Q-analysis in the social sciences. This paper is to me a flag indicating that maybe it is better not to bring Q-analysis into the list of applications of simplical complexes.
