GUDHI

On Gudi Padwa, a gudi is found hanging out of a window or otherwise
prominently displayed in traditional Maharashtrian households. Gudi is
a bright green or yellow cloth adorned with brocade (zari) tied to the
tip of a long bamboo over which gathi (sugar crystals), neem
leaves[citation needed], a twig of mango leaves and a garland of red
flowers is tied. A silver or copper pot is placed in the inverted
position over it. This gudi is then hoisted outside the house, in a
window, terrace or a high place so that everybody can see it.

Some of the significances attributed to raising a Gudhi are as follows:

    Gudhi symbolizes the Brahmadhvaj (translation: Brahma’s flag)
    mentioned in the Brahma Purana, because Lord Brahma created the
    universe on this day. It may also represent Indradhvaj
    (translation: the flag of Indra).[5]

   Mythologically, the Gudhi symbolizes Lord Rama’s victory and
   happiness on returning to Ayodhya after slaying Ravan. Since a symbol
   of victory is always held high, so is the gudi (flag). It is believed
   that this festival is celebrated to commemorate the coronation of Rama
   post his return to Ayodhya after completing 14 years of exile.5

    Maharashtrians also see the Gudhi as a symbol of victory
    associated with the conquests of the Maratha forces led by
    Chhatrapati Shivaji. It also symbolizes the victory of King
    Shalivahana over Sakas and was hoisted by his people when he
    returned to Paithan.[5] Gudhi is believed to ward off evil, invite
    prosperity and good luck into the house.[5]


INPUT : Types of data
-- point clouds
-- isomanifold in digital images (examples?)
-- shapes defined implicitly as a system of equations 
-- black box model
-- hyperspectral images

What makes higher dimensional shapes different
-- dimension 
-- importance of topology : cc (clustering), holes, cavities (homology)
-- classification of surfaces known,  problematic in higher dim 
-- complexity (size of good  samples)

OUTPUT

Approximation
-- projection onto affine space (linear methods): PCA, DFT (discrete
Fourier transform), random projections
-- embedding in affine space while preserving distances (spectral methods) : MDS, local : LLE,
Isomap, Laplacian eigenmaps
-- simplicial complexes and nerves

   		 topological approximation :  preserving homology,
		 homotopy  type, topological type (homeomorphism) 

		 metric approximation (different from embedding,
		 e.g. tree embedding, "instrinsic" algorithms)

		 simplification/refinement/incremental construction
		  approximation by graphs, low dimensional complexes

-- Morse Smale complexes
-- multiscale analysis

Segmentation/feature/structure extraction
-- clustering, separation, SVM
-- skeletonization (Reeb graph)
-- detection of substructures :  e.g. graph, filaments etc
-- signatures/shape descriptors
-- boundaries, singularities, highly curved regions
-- topological invariants : Betti numbers, generators of the homology
groups
-- model-based clustering


Shape similarity
-- distance between shapes (Hausdorff, Fr\'echet, Gromov-Hausdorff)
-- detection of symmetries, similarities
-- shape matching and recognition

TECHNIQUES

-- simplicial complexes
-- distance function
-- persistent homology
-- Laplacian operator, discrete differential geometry
-- discrete Morse theory
-- computational metric geometry


APPLICATIONS

-- meshes for numerical simulations
-- topological data analysis
-- visualization of data, visual representation, walk through data
