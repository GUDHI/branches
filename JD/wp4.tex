\subsection*{WP 4 :  Platform for geometric modelling in higher dimensions}
Development of a C++ platform that implements the best algorithms developed during the project or by external collaborators. Set up datasets for controlled experiments in support of WP 1-3, and more generally, research on Geometric Modeling in higher dimensions.  Diffuse the software and promote its use in fields like Machine Learning, Data Analysis, Numerical Simulation, Visualization, Structural Biology and others. 

A small but significant part of the project will be dedicated to gathering datasets. These data sets will be made publicly available. % It is important to compare the algorithms on datasets that are representative of realistic tasks.
They will include both synthetic datasets and datasets coming from the application domains listed above. This will be done in collaboration with expert groups with whom we are in close contact.
