/** \brief Concept defining a discrete metric space. 
 *
 * The metric space contains a finite set of elements defined by
 * a type Vertex, and a distance between each pair of Vertices is
 * defined.
 *
 * Remark: the distance may be more general, like a similarity 
 * measure, and simply needs to be symmetric.
 * 
 * If the space does not have a distance, we define the discrete
 * distance satisfying: \f$\text{d}(x,y) = 0\f$ if \f$x \neq y\f$
 * and \f$0\f$ otherwise. */
