/**
 * \brief Defines a metric space. A metric space contains
 * elements that are known by the type Vertex. Each element 
 * of the metric space is assigned a unique Vertex.
 * Pairwise distances can be computed.
 *
 * Remark: the distance may be more general, like a similarity m
 * measure, and simply needs to be symmetric.
 * 
 * If the space does not have a distance, we define the discrete
 * distance satisfying: f(x,y) = 0 if x!=y and 0 otherwise.
 *
 * \todo Defines the exact properties of the distance function.
