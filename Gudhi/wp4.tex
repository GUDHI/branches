\subsection*{Focus Area 4 : A software platform for geometry understanding in higher
  dimensions}
\framebox{software environment, software medium?}

We intend to develop an open source software platform of highest
quality % that will provide a comprehensive \framebox{sure?} and robust
% set of tools
for geometric understanding in high dimension.  The goal
is not to provide code for the numerous potential applications but
rather to provide the central data structures and algorithms that
underly any application in geometry understanding in higher
dimensions.

The development of such a
platform will necessitate a full research work on architecture and
interface design, heuristics and fine-tuning optimization, robustness
and arithmetics issues. It will also serve to benchmark and optimize any
new algorithmic solution resulting from our theoretical work. 
%
% \paragraph{The need for a software platform.}
% On one hand, we perceive the development of such a platform as 
% an absolute necessity to serve as a test bench and  evaluation process
% for any new algorithmic solution resulting  from  our theoretical work.
% On the other hand, we perceive the development of such a platform as
% a full research work. Indeed we are convinced that, as robustness
% issues triggered the development of a whole branch of theoretical
% work, known as Geometric Computing, the need for
% highly efficient implementations to walk around the curse of  
% dimensionality,  will participate in the emergence of relevant
% concepts for new algorithmic foundations
% of  geometric understanding in high dimension.
%
% The term platform means that we intend to capitalize upon development
% efforts and encourage contributions from researchers external to the
% project.  At the end of this project, the platform will offer a
% comprehensive and robust set of algorithmic tools for geometry
% processing and analysis in higher dimensional spaces.
%
% We also think about this platform as the choice
% vector for the diffusion of our algorithmic solutions 
% into application domains, such as astrophysics
% or structural biology) 
%  where the need for handling high dimensional
% data crucially arises.  Such a diffusion in various fields
%  will in turn provide for various bench set data 
% and user feedback.
%
% \paragraph{State of the art.}  
% Leaving aside the flourishing field of machine learning
% and well-known successful software for linear algebra,
% linear and quadratic optimization,  only  few implementations handle
% geometry in high dimension. 
% Most of those software use multiscale  grids based
% data structures that somehow adapt
%  to the local  density of data.
% A typical example is the popular ANN software to compute  the approximate
% nearest-neighbor of a query point
% among a  high dimensional point cloud. 
% Qhull is a software that can compute convex hulls and Delaunay
% triangulations in dimensions larger than 3, but it doesn't see much
% development anymore, and as the authors prominently announce on the
% webpage: ``Qhull does not support triangulation of non-convex surfaces,
% mesh generation of non-convex objects, medium-sized inputs in 9-D and
% higher, alpha shapes''. The polymake framework has many features,
% it can handle several types of complexes, build Voronoi diagrams and
% compute advanced topological characteristics of objects like a finite
% representation of the fundamental group. However, it is strongly
% oriented towards an interactive use for mathematical experimentation on
% a given object and not automated, fast and robust data processing.
% % C'est l'impression que j'en ai apres avoir un peu surfe sur differents
% % sites, mais je n'ai pas une confiance absolue dans ce que je dis
% % ci-dessus.
% Only two implementations of persistent homology algorithms are
% currently available. One of them is the PLEX package for Matlab,
% developed by the Computational Topology group at Stanford University.
% The other one is the
% library Dionysus proposed by Dmitriy Morozov. These implementations
% %do not propose parallel nor out-of-core versions. They 
% are known to be
% successful in small dimensions but inefficient as soon as the
% dimension rises.  Their  maintenance, only assumed by the very few authors
% is likely not to be perennial.

%
% %\paragraph{Methodology.} 
% Two key requirements in the development of this platform will be
% efficiency and theoretical guarantees, including handling of
% robustness issues.
We aim at providing  a full programming environment
% % A common
% % platform is ideal for these goals, as it allows for more
% % resources to be poured into 
% the optimization, bug-fixing and interface
% design than for a single prototype.
% as well as the appropriate infrastructure. This includes a
% comprehensive documentation, a web site, a bug report mechanism and
% communication channels towards developers inside and outside the Gudhi
% project (mailing lists, developer workshops, etc.).
%
%We intend to apply to the development of this software platform the
following the very recipes that made up the success story of the CGAL
library.  

An important aspect of the work is also to educate students and young
researchers and to offer them a multidisciplinary expertise covering
the mathematical, algorithmic and implementation aspects of the subject.

%\paragraph{Architecture design.}

\paragraph{Data structures.}
The software platform will provide tools to extract from clouds of
points the simplicial complexes that are relevant for geometric
understanding, Rips, tangential Delaunay and witness complexes to
begin with.  The platform will provide efficient implementation of
data structures to represent those complexes. In
particular, the compact data structures developed in WP1 will be fully
tested and benchmarked against other representations.

\paragraph{Basic algorithms.}
The platform will offer a well chosen set of basic algorithms at the
heart of geometry understanding in higher dimensions. It will 
include in particular algorithms to
{\em sample},  {\em mesh} and {\em  reconstruct manifolds}, 
 compute the {\em persistent homology} of simplicial complex filtrations,
{\em cluster data}, compute {\em signatures of shapes}. It will also
provide some visualization tools.


The platform will aim at providing parallel implementations as well
as out-of-core versions whenever possible to make possible the
handling of huge data sets in high dimensions.

\paragraph{Applications.}
Although the Gudhi project is of a fundamental nature, our approach
and, in particular the software platform, will be used in prototype
applications.  This will validate our approach and tools, and bring
novel methodologies to some critical applications. We have established
contacts with researchers in neurosciences, medical imaging,
astrophysics, and dynamical systems with whom we will collaborate. 

We
will in particular establish a strong collaboration with F. Cazals in molecular
biology. A protein or any macromolecule with $n$ atoms is a flexible
system with 3n degrees of freedom whose dymamics is fully described by
a point in  a 6n dimensional positions-velocities phase space. Dynamic molecular
simulations or MonteCarlo computations are  able to provide samplings of the
energy landscape of a molecular system in its phase space.
Using our tools for geometric understanding,
we planed to study the persistent homology of the level sets of those molecular
energy landscapes. A key question being
to derive collective coordinates describing large amplitude - low
frequency deformations, a process reminiscent from dimensionality
reduction, we ambition to design collective coordinates incorporating
the homological constraints --- a topic which has not yet been addressed
\cite{wales}.



\paragraph{Datasets.}
To benchmark our algorithms, it is important to dispose of datasets
that are representative of realistic tasks. Some datasets exist in the
machine learning community (e.g. http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/), in
the computer vision (...), in molecular biology
(http://www.cs.otago.ac.nz/staff/Shawn\_Martin). We will create a
public repository for new  datasets, including synthetic datasets with controlled
parameters. Providing easy access to such data sets is an important service to the
research community of geometry understanding in higher dimensions and 
will help building a standard for benchmarking algorithms in the field.


\paragraph{Infrastructure and diffusion.}
The development infrastructure will include a web site, a
comprehensive documentation, a svn repository, and daily running of
testsuites on several hardware architectures.  We will set up an
editorial board to be in charge of the review of new packages
submitted for inclusion in the platform.  One strategic goal is to
give to the platform sufficient momentum so that it will be attract
interest of a large community of researchers in computational geometry
and various applicative fields, and serve as a standard for
experimental research. This is important for the development of new
tools as well as for the perennial maintenance of the software. In
addition to a vigorous effort towards code diffusion, we will set up
appropriate communication channels towards developers inside and
outside the Gudhi project, including mailing lists, developer
workshops, publications and talks at conferences in applied domains.
