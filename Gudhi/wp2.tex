\subsection*{WP 2:  Dimension-sensitive algorithms and data structures} 

Central to the techniques we intend to develop is the construction of simplicial complexes.  A graph is an example of a 1-dimensional simplicial complex but simplicial complexes are much more powerful than graphs and allow to approximate complicated shapes of arbitrary dimension and topology. They offer a flexible data structure to represent and process higher-dimensional shapes and recent developments have shown that simplicial complexes computed on top of point clouds are primary tools to capture the topology of the underlying space of the data. 

In 3-dimensions, 2 and 3-dimensional simplicial complexes of surfaces and volumes are widely used in graphics, scientific computing and manufacturing. Because of its numerous interesting properties and of the existence of extremely efficient algorithms to compute it, the Delaunay triangulation has become one of the most famous and widely used geometric data structures that spread out accross all sciences. The algorithms we have implemented in CGAL are among the most reliable and fast algorithms. They have been included in the heart of MATLAB. 

The algorithms used in 3 dimensions extend to any dimension but their complexity grows exponentially with the dimension which makes them useless for real applications beyong say dimension 6~\cite{avis,hornus}.  In order for algorithms and implementations to scale with the dimension, we need to exploit (hidden) structure of the data and to design dimension-sensitive algorithms and data structures.

% our focus is not on worst-case complexity, but on (provably) good performance under some given structural properties of the input. These properties may be of statistical nature (when we are dealing with noise, for example), or of geometric nature (when data is of low intrinsic dimension, say). Related to this, we are also aiming at output-sensitive algorithms.

\paragraph{Design of small yet faithfull simplicial complexes.} 
Given a set of points $V$ in $\R ^d$, a number of simplicial complexes
with vertex set $V$ have been proposed. A first class of simplicial
complexes uses a parameter $\alpha$ which can be used to order the
simplices of the complex.

The \u{C}ech complex is the nerve of the set $B_{\alpha}$ of balls of
radius $\alpha$ centered at the points of $V$. The nerve of
$B_{\alpha}$  associates a
$i$-simplex to any subset of $i+1$ balls that have a common
intersection. This is a simplicial
complex that is in general not embeddable in $\R ^d$. Moreover, it is usually very big and
difficult to compute since it requires to detect whether a subset of
balls of  $\R ^d$ intersect. 

A simpler to compute simplicial complex is the Rips complex whose
edges are the same as for the \u{C}ech complex. The higher dimensional
simplices of the Rips complex are obtained by computing the cliques of
sizes 3, 4 etc. in the graph of the edges. This simplicial complex is
much easier to compute than the \u{C}ech complex and it has the
vremarkable property that it can be constructed in a purely
combinatorial way from 
its 1-skeleton.  Such a simplicial complex is called a {\em flag
  complex}. Nevertheless, the Rips complex is not embedded in $\R ^d$
and may have a dimension much higher than the dimension of the underlying structure
of the data.


Various simplicial complexes have been derived from the Delaunay
triangulation of the vertices. The $\alpha$-complex is the nerve of
the restriction of the Delaunay triangulation to the union of the
balls of $B_{\alpha}$. This complex is embedded in $\R^d$ (provided
that the vertices are in general position) but very difficult to
compute in high dimension for the same reason as the \u{C}ech complex.

Other simplicial complexes derived from the Delaunay triangulation do
not involve any parameter, most notably the restricted Delaunay
triangulation, the tangential Delaunay complex and the witness
complex. Those complexes are
especially designed for the case where $V$ samples a topological space
of small dimension $k$, the central hypothesis in Machine
Learning. Both the restricted and the tangential Delaunay complexes are embedded in $\R^d$, have dimension $k$
(under a mild general position assumption). Still, these simplicial
complexes are limited to small $k$.  The witness complex is
another variant of the Delaunay triangulation introduced by
Vin de Silva and Carlsson. The witness complex is embedded in $\R ^d$
and is remarkably easy to compute in any dimension
since the only numerical operations involves in its construction are
comparisons of distances.

It should be noted that the Rips complex and the witness complex can
both be computed from the knowledge of the distances between the
vertices. Hence these complexes can be computed in any discrete metric
space.

 Currently no code allows to manipulate simplicial complexes of arbitrary dimension in a routine way as is possible for 2 and 3-dimensional triangulations of $\R ^3$ \cite{springerflo,DBLP:journals/tog/PaoluzziBCF93,svy-crm-99}. 

We identify four research directions~:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Classifying simplicial complexes
\item Combinatorial and algorithmic complexity 
\item Compact representation
\item New types of simplicial complexes
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Classifying simplicial complexes.}
Some equivalences between the various types of simplicial complexes are known. For example,
the Rips and the \u{C}ech complexes are identical for the $L_1$ norm and for the Euclidean norm, we have 
\[ \rips () \subset \cech () \subset \rips () .\]
Recently, we have established conditions under which the witness complex, the restricted Delaunay triangulation and the tangential complex are identical~\cite{}. A more complete classification is required to better understand these structures and their properties. 
It would also lead to  better algorithms.



\paragraph{Combinatorial and algorithmic complexity.}
A main limitation of using simplicial complexes is their combinatorial and algorithmic complexity.  Differently from polytopes, very few results are known. The flag random complex is a noticeable exception~\cite{}. Other types of random abstract complexes have to be studied from a combinatorial point of view. Geometric simplicial complexes should also be considered.  An especially important question is to obtain complexity bounds for simplicial complexes of well sampled substructures (e.g. submanifolds).  We intend to measure the effect of perturbations (either noise or computed perturbations) on the mathematical properties and combinatorial complexity of those structures, and to develop probabilistic analyses. In addition to their combinatorial complexity, the complexity of the construction of the simplicial complexes is to be analyzed.  Parallel and out-of-core algorithms will be also developed.


\paragraph{Compact representation of simplicial complexes.} We are aware of only a few works on the design of data structures for general simplicial complexes. Brisson~\cite{Brisson:1989:RGS:73833.73858} and Lienhardt~\cite{DBLP:journals/ijcga/Lienhardt94} have introduced data structures to represent $d$-dimensional cell complexes, most notably subdivided manifolds. While those data structures have nice algebraic properties, they are very redundant and do not scale to large data sets or high dimensions. More recently, Attali et al.~\cite{Attali2011} have proposed an efficient data structure to represent and simplify flag complexes, a special family of simplicial complexes including the Rips complex. 
Recently, we have experimented with a tree representation for general simplicial
complexes that seems to perform very well. Simplicial complexes of 500 millions of simplices have been constructed and stored on a laptop~\cite{}. 
Theoretical guarantees and experiments on a large scale are mandatory. In
addition, more compact storage could be further obtained by using
well-known succinct representations of trees~\cite{10.1109/SFCS.1989.63533,Munro:2002:SRB:586840.586885,Ferragina:2005:SLT:1097112.1097456,DBLP:conf/icalp/2003}. The problem of finding minimal representations of simplicial complexes is widely open beyond the planar case.


\paragraph{New types of simplicial complexes.}
Among the simplicial complexes discussed above, only the Rips and the witness complexes can be constructed on a discrete metric space where only the distances between points are known. The Delaunay-like simplicial complexes are based on a distance function, usually the Euclidean distance.  Other distance functions and, in particular, geodesic distances would lead to Intrinsic simplicial complexes. First encouraging results in this direction can be found in \cite{}.


\paragraph{Validation.} \framebox{in WP 4?}
We intend to {\em implement} those structures, experiment with them and see how they behave under realistic conditions. We will use known datasets such as the UCI repository \cite{} and also propose new benchmarks that we will make publicly available with the hope that they will be used to compare data structures and algorithms.
