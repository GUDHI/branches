\section*{Focus Area 2: Triangulation of non Euclidean metric spaces}

% Geometric spaces, such as the space of solutions associated with a
% nonlinear system, frequently appear as a structure of interest
% associated with a problem.  A detailed and accurate discrete model of
% such a space is the best representation possible for computational
% purposes. A simplicial complex can fill that role;
The challenge is to develop algorithms that can construct simplicial
complexes approximating manifolds and spaces which cannot be
represented as subsets of 3-dimensional Euclidean space, and to do
this efficiently and with guarantees on the approximation qualities of
the output.
%
An example of a traditionally desired guarantee is the requirement
that the constructed complex be homeomorphic to the original space.

\paragraph{Intrinsic Delaunay triangulations of Riemannian manifolds.}

% 1. why is it important
% -- submanifolds 
% -- context where RM appear naturally without an embedding: statistical
% manifolds? discrete metric space, shape space [Mumford] 
The Delaunay paradigm has proven to be central to the development and
understanding of meshing algorithms, whether the domain of interest is
a full dimensional subset of $\rdee$, or a more general manifold. 
%
Locally a manifold can be well approximated by a Euclidean space, and
this is the main idea exploited by dimension reduction and dimension
detection algorithms. In fact, this same theme can be found at the
heart of anisotropic meshing algorithms and global meshing and
reconstruction algorithms. The problem then comes down to ensuring
that the locally constructed complexes knit together into a coherent
whole. This issue is tackled by manipulating the complex either
through strategic refinement or perturbation of weights defining the
neighbour relations. 

The underlying problem is that the Delaunay paradigm is being applied
where the underlying metric is not Euclidean.  In order to strengthen
the theoretical foundations for tackling these issues, we intend to
develop a deeper understanding of the intrinsic Delaunay complex
defined by a Riemannian metric.
%
% 2. what is known
% -- anisotropic meshes
% -- Leibon Letscher
% Previously announced sampling criteria~\cite{leibon2000} for intrinsic
% Delaunay triangulations have recently been demonstrated to be
% insufficient~\cite{boissonnat2012stab}; in addition to density
% criteria it is essential that the points be bounded away from
% degenerate configurations. Algorithms for anisotropic meshing already
% implicitly strive to achieve this condition~\cite{bwy-luam-08}.

% 3. workplan
% -- conditions for the existence of fully intrinsic DT on RM
% -- algorithms to construct DT on RM
% -- anisotropic meshes 
% -- meshes for Bregman manifolds,
The conditions for such intrinsic Delaunay triangulations have so far
only been established through extrinsic criteria related to manifolds
embedded in Euclidean space. We plan to establish sampling criteria
based only on intrinsic properties of the manifold. In this abstract
setting, the techniques required to demonstrate a homeomorphism with
the original manifold will be different, but likely more generally
useful, than those so far developed for specific substructures of an
ambient Delaunay triangulation.  We will then develop an algorithm to
construct the intrinsic Delaunay complex.  Since exact computation of
geodesic distances is out of reach in many cases, in particular when
the manifold is only known through a point sample, we will develop
algorithms that are robust with respect to approximate intrinsic
distance computations. We will take inspiration from our recent work
on anisotropic mesh generation~\cite{bwy-luam-08}.
% on a controlled
% perturbation of a given point set, rather than refining the point set
% as required in previous algorithms.
We expect that these results will lead to insight into the meshing of
manifolds equipped with alternatives to a metric, such as Bregman
divergences with locally defined potential functions.

\paragraph{Manifold reconstruction using Delaunay-like structures.}

% 1. why is it important
% -- alternative to DT
% -- no need for higher arithmetics
% -- usable in any discrete metric space
% -- landmark selection
%
The tangential complex paved the way for a manifold reconstruction
algorithm that does not depend exponentially on the ambient dimension
\cite{geometrica-7142i}, 
% However the algorithm is still bound to
% evaluate Delaunay triangulations of the dimension of the manifold, so
% geometric predicates involving polynomials whose degree is that of the
% manifold severely limit the dimension of the manifolds that can be
% handled.  The witness complex~\cite{deSilva2008} is showing potential
% to be an effective route to computationally efficient and conceptually
% simple Delaunay meshing and reconstruction. Its computation depends on
% the evaluation of much simpler geometric predicates than is required
% by the Delaunay complex, and it is well defined on discrete metric
% spaces, where the Delaunay complex lacks a natural definition.
and we would like to extend this success to witness complex based
techniques which are free of expensive geometric predicates:
%
so far, the complexity of witness complex
based manifold reconstruction is exponential in the ambient dimension
$d$.
% , and whether it can be made only polynomial in $d$ remains an
% open question we want to address by borrowing ideas from the
% tangential complex and using insights developed from investigations of
% intrinsic Delaunay triangulations, we will also develop algorithms and
% guarantees for witness complexes representing manifolds that are
% presented only as a discrete metric space.
As a first step in that direction, we established sufficient (albeit
quite restrictive) conditions under which the witness complex, and the
restricted Delaunay triangulation are
identical~\cite{boissonnat2011cgl}.
%

As yet, no algorithm for landmark selection has been developed which
meets the required sampling conditions.  We plan to develop the
techniques of controlled perturbation~\cite{funke2005cp} in this
context, using the tangential complex paradigm to avoid dependence on
the ambient dimension.

% The challenge remains that the topology of the witness complex is not
% well understood.  Conditions which guarantee that the restrcited
% Delaunay complex is homeomorphic to the manifold are different from
% those which ensure that it coincides with the witness complex. 


%
% 2. what is known
% -- de Silva's result
% -- reconstruction in time exp. in d
% -- sufficient conditions for identity with RDT
% The witness complex is built on a set $L$ of landmarks, through
% consultation with a set $W$ of witnesses. If the set $W$ is taken to
% be all of $\rdee$, then it is known~\cite{deSilva2008}, that the
% witness complex is equal to the Delaunay complex on $L$. However, in
% practice $W$ is taken to be a dense finite set. 
% %
% Simple distance comparisons between points in $W$ and points in $L$
% are employed instead of the expensive determinant evaluations required
% by traditional Delaunay algorithms.
% %
% It has
% recently been shown~\cite{boissonnat2011cgl} that if $W$ is a finite
% set sufficiently Hausdorff close to a compact smooth manifold $\man
% \subset \rdee$, then sampling conditions for $L$ exist which ensure
% that the witness complex is equal to the Delaunay complex restricted
% to $\man$.

% 3. workplan
% -- reconstruction in time linear in k
% -- reconstruction in discrete metric spaces
% -- sampling strategy for selecting witnesses
% We will develop an algorithm for reconstructing a witness complex
% homeomorphic to a manifold, that is presented only as a dense point
% cloud. %$W \subset \rdee$. 
% The challenge is to develop a strategy for
% selecting landmark sites so that the required genericity conditions
% are met, and to do this in a way that does not introduce expensive
% geometric predicates. 


\paragraph{Crude models.}

% 1. why is it important
% -- conditions for precise reconstruction unrealistic
% -- simplicial complexes too heavy
% -- find a compromise between dimension reduction techniques and
% topological methods 
The homeomorphism guarantees obtained for triangulating a manifold
still generally demand sampling criteria which are not realistic in
practice. Even if the manifold is known to sufficient precision to
permit such sampling, more light-weight representations may be
preferred in some applications.  In order to progress towards
practical algorithms with meaningful guarantees, satisfactory
compromises must be found.
%
% 2. what is known
% -- Collapsing
% -- Reeb graph and skeletons
% -- tree reconstruction [Chazal-Guibas]
%%%%%%
% I don't know if these examples address the issue that I think we
% want to present (I don't know tree recon). In particular, can we
% produce a Reeb graph or skeleton with quantifiable guarantees on the
% topology under significantly weaker sampling conditions than is
% required for full reconstruction? These may be lighter weight output
% structures, but I am not sure that is the issue -- the issue I see
% is how to meaninfully measure the quality of the output
% representation, given the input quality?
%
% One approach has been to forego a full representation of the manifold,
% and instead strive to obtain the associated homology groups. The
% guarantees on the output are then probabilistic, depending on the
% sampling density~\cite{nsw-fhm-2008}, which must nonetheless be high.
% This is the challenging problem at the heart of our proposal: finding
% quality measures that enable some kind of theoretical guarantees even
% in the face of corrupt and insufficient data. \ramsay{what has been
%   done really? statistical stuff: sparse representations ...}

% 3. workplan
% -- transport distance
% -- ??
We plan to explore two avenues to address the problem. On the one
hand, we will strive to attain relaxed, parameterisable, approximation
quality measures that yield a meaningful comparison between the
algorithmic output and the underlying manifold represented by the
given input data. This approach is applicable in the case where the
manifold is known to high precision, and only the output
representation is crude, due to a fixed vertex budget, for
example. Evaluations based on Gromov-Hausdorff distance,
or Wasserstein-type distances will be investigated.

On the other hand, an approach that is appropriate when crude input
data is the only explicit information about the underlying manifold,
is to assume that the manifold belongs to some restricted family of
manifolds which can be distinguished from each other on the basis of
little information. Thus we wish to be able to prove that the output
represents the ``projection'' of the true manifold into a restricted
space of manifolds.

\paragraph{Stratified manifolds.}

% 1. why is it important
% -- C_8H_{16}
While manifold triangulation and reconstruction in higher dimensions
already represents a challenge for effective practical algorithms,
there is a need to progress to more complicated objects than
manifolds. Stratified manifolds represent a potentially tractable yet
flexible generalisation that can model many known naturally occurring
structures. Examples include conformation spaces of molecules, such as
that discovered for cyclo-octane~\cite{mtcw-tco-2010}, and also the
invariant sets that appear in dynamical systems~\cite{mh-mpc-2002}.
%
% 2. what is known
% -- surfaces, protecting balls
% -- continuation for bifurcations
% -- boundaries (Munkres)
Methods have been developed for meshing and reconstructing surfaces
with boundaries. Also, algorithms have been proposed for separating
the strata of stratified manifolds~\cite{bendich2007}; the resulting
strata being manifolds with boundaries. 

% 3. workplan
We plan to develop algorithms for meshing and reconstructing manifolds
with boundary with an aim for applications to stratified
manifolds. 
% Thus a complementary task will be to triangulate a manifold
% whose boundary has already been triangulated, and thus obtain a means
% to reconstruct a stratified manifold by identifying the common
% component strata. 
New ideas will be required to develop sampling conditions which can
yield guarantees for these structures. The algorithms will draw upon
the theory developed for pure manifolds, as well as the geometric
inference algorithms discussed in Focus Area 3. In particular, linear
subspace clustering approaches will be required locally to resolve
different strata.
