\paragraph{Topological signatures for shapes}

Shape descriptors are used in a variety of applications, including
shape classification, shape retrieval, shape matching, shape
registration, and symmetry detection. In the context of this proposal,
the word {\em shape} must be understood in a very broad sense: for
instance, it can be a point cloud, or a
manifold, or more generally a compact metric space.

Using measured topological quantities to design signatures for shapes
is a relatively new idea. The bottom line of the approach is the
following: given a finite sampling of the shape, build some filtered
simplicial complex on top of the point cloud, and use the topological
structure of this filtration (encoded as a planar diagram called a
{\em persistence diagram}) as a signature for the point
cloud~\cite{ccgmo-ghsssp-09, sog-hks-09}. This construction is
well-suited for finite metric spaces, and the obtained signatures are
known to be stable under small perturbations of the spaces in the
Gromov-Hausdorff distance.  

A major remaining challenge is to extend the
construction to infinite metric spaces, and to prove the stability of
its topological structure with respect to perturbations of the space
in the Gromov-Hausdorff distance.

%An important shortcoming of topological signatures is
%to be scale-dependent: a scaling of the sampled shape
%results in a scaling of the filtration and of its persistence
%diagram. Can some ``optimal'' scaling factor minimizing the distance
%between parsistence diagrams be found automatically? 

A more fundamental question is how much information about a shape can
be recovered from descriptors. Previous work in shape analysis only
provides lower bounds on a shape distance (e.g. the Gromov-Hausdorff
distance) based on descriptor distance~\cite{survey on
  signatures?}. In other words, equivalent or closely-related shapes
do have equal or similar signatures, but significantly different
shapes may also have similar signatures. It is desirable to go the
other way --- to upper bound shape similarity based on descriptor
similarity. This objective does not seem out of reach in our case:
thanks to the virtually infinite variety of filtrations that can be
built on top of a shape, it is easy to enrich the pool of signatures
used for that shape, and thus restrict the possibility of false
positives in the shape comparison process. It is then a question of
how large a family of filtrations is required to guarantee that
different shapes do get different signatures. And from an algorithmic
perspective, it is also important to identify small samplings of this
family of filtrations that can be used as proxies for a better (if not
perfect) assessment of the similarity between two shapes.

Finally, the difficulty of matching two shapes is
intimately tied to matching a shape to itself --- shapes with many
natural self maps (symmetries) can be difficult to match because of
the ambiguities symmetries create (reflected in duplicate descriptors,
etc.). It may be interesting to define some sort of {\em condition
  number} for a shape, which would capture the intrinsic difficulty of
characteristic or matching against that shape.
