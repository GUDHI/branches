% \paragraph{A cultural note.}
% A gudhi is found hanging out of a window or otherwise
% prominently displayed in traditional Maharashtrian households. Gudhi is
% a bright green or yellow cloth adorned with brocade (zari) tied to the
% tip of a long bamboo over which gathi (sugar crystals), neem
% leaves, a twig of mango leaves and a garland of red
% flowers is tied. A silver or copper pot is placed in the inverted
% position over it. This gudhi is then hoisted outside the house, in a
% window, terrace or a high place so that everybody can see it.

% Some of the significances attributed to raising a Gudhi are as follows:

%  --   Gudhi symbolizes the Brahmadhvaj (translation: Brahma’s flag)
%     mentioned in the Brahma Purana, because Lord Brahma created the
%     universe on this day. It may also represent Indradhvaj
%     (translation: the flag of Indra).

% --   Mythologically, the Gudhi symbolizes Lord Rama’s victory and
%    happiness on returning to Ayodhya after slaying Ravan. Since a symbol
%    of victory is always held high, so is the gudhi (flag). It is believed
%    that this festival is celebrated to commemorate the coronation of Rama
%    post his return to Ayodhya after completing 14 years of exile.

% --    Maharashtrians also see the Gudhi as a symbol of victory
%     associated with the conquests of the Maratha forces led by
%     Chhatrapati Shivaji. It also symbolizes the victory of King
%     Shalivahana over Sakas and was hoisted by his people when he
%     returned to Paithan. Gudhi is believed to ward off evil, invite
%     prosperity and good luck into the house.
