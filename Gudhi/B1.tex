\paragraph{Proposal summary.} 
The central focus of this proposal is the computer analysis of
geometric structures, which we refer to as {\em geometry
  understanding}.  The need for analyzing geometric structures is
ubiquitous in science and has become an essential part of scientific
computing and data analysis. Geometry understanding is by no means
limited to 3-dimensions and many applications in physics, biology and
engineering require a keen understanding of the geometry of a variety
of higher dimensional spaces. Let us mention phase space in particle
physics, invariant manifolds in dynamical systems, configuration
spaces of mechanical systems, conformational spaces of molecules,
image manifolds, or shape spaces.
%
% High-dimensional spaces and shapes
% are ubiquitous in science.  Let us mention the  4-dimensional {\em space-time},  {\em phase space} in particle physics, {\em configuration spaces} of mechanical systems, {\em conformational spaces} of macromolecules.  Although their needs may be very different, numerical simulations, motion planning, molecular docking are among celebrated applications where approximating and processing high-dimensional objects is a central issue. 
{\em Data analysis}  is another place where understanding
geometry in high-dimensional spaces is needed to
capture concise information from the underlying structure of the data.  % A powerful data model for many applications is the
% geometric notion of low-dimensional manifold 
% %  Data analysis
% % can be turned into a geometric problem by encoding heteregeneous data
% % as clouds of points in high dimensional spaces equiped with some
% % appropriate metric. Usually those points are not distributed in the
% % whole embedding space but, due to the very nature of the system that
% % produced those data, lie close to some low-dimensional
% % manifold. Hence, the data conveys some geometric structure
%  whose
% extraction and analysis are key to understanding the underlying
% system.
Since data are produced at an unprecedented rate in all
sciences, understanding the geometry of high-dimensional data %point clouds
has become a core task in science and engineering.

% The last decade has seen tremendous progress in processing high-dimensional shapes and spaces in various areas like robotics, machine learning and computational geometry.
% % Most  of these methods have limited guarantees and 
% % impose strong constraints on the dimension or the topology of the shapes they can successfully handle.
% The field of {\em computational topology} emerged as a new field to provide solid foundations for the effective understanding of complex shapes
% % The concepts of $\varepsilon$-samples, restricted Delaunay triangulation, anisotropic meshes emerged together with the first efficient and provably correct algorithms for emblematic problems like mesh generation and shape reconstruction in 3-dimensions.
% %
% %  The attempt to extend these results to higher dimensions led to the development of beautiful pieces of theory with deep roots in various areas of mathematics like Riemannian geometry, geometric measure theory, differential and algebraic topology. Let us mention  the emergence of a sampling theory of geometric objects and of geometric inference, and the groundbreaking invention and rapid growth of persistent homology.
% %
% and %Although of a fundamental nature, these advances 
% attracted  interest in biological data analysis, speech recognition, computer vision and sensor networks.
% However, the current theory has not demonstrated its scalability to
% real problems and, up to now, it has only been applied to rather
% simple cases and in low dimensions. This is  due to the lack of
% satisfactory algorithmic solutions in high-dimensional spaces.

%This project intends to break the {\em computational bottleneck}.  
The ambition of this proposal is to settle the {\em algorithmic
foundations} of geometry understanding in 
{\em dimensions higher than 3}.  We intend to develop {\em practical algorithms} to approximate
highly nonlinear manifolds, and to infer geometric and topological
properties from data subject to significant {\em defects} and under
{\em realistic conditions}. 
%
% We aim at processing general highly nonlinear manifolds
% with nontrivial topologies, to approximate 
% highly nonlinear manifolds, and to infer geometric and topological
% properties from data subject to significant {\em defects} and under
% {\em realistic conditions}.  
As is common in many applications, we will assume that  the objects of
interest can be modeled as {\em low-dimensional manifolds} 
embedded in possibly high-dimensional spaces.
To  bypass the computational bottleneck, we will 
exploit the {\em intrinsic properties} of the objects and design
dimension-sensitive data structures and algorithms.%models in the form of {\em simplicial complexes}.

This proposal adresses {\em fundamental
  research} issues and its results are expected to serve as a basis
for groundbreaking advances for {\em applications in scientific computing
and data analysis}.  A major outcome of the project will be a
high-quality open source software {\em platform} 
that will implement the main results.

To reach these objectives, the guiding principle  will be to simultaneously
develop {\em mathematical approaches} providing theoretical
guarantees, {\em effective algorithms} that are amenable to
theoretical analysis and rigorous experimental validation, and {\em
  perennial software} development.

% \paragraph{A cultural note.}
% A gudhi is found hanging out of a window or otherwise
% prominently displayed in traditional Maharashtrian households. Gudhi is
% a bright green or yellow cloth adorned with brocade (zari) tied to the
% tip of a long bamboo over which gathi (sugar crystals), neem
% leaves, a twig of mango leaves and a garland of red
% flowers is tied. A silver or copper pot is placed in the inverted
% position over it. This gudhi is then hoisted outside the house, in a
% window, terrace or a high place so that everybody can see it.

% Some of the significances attributed to raising a Gudhi are as follows:

%  --   Gudhi symbolizes the Brahmadhvaj (translation: Brahma’s flag)
%     mentioned in the Brahma Purana, because Lord Brahma created the
%     universe on this day. It may also represent Indradhvaj
%     (translation: the flag of Indra).

% --   Mythologically, the Gudhi symbolizes Lord Rama’s victory and
%    happiness on returning to Ayodhya after slaying Ravan. Since a symbol
%    of victory is always held high, so is the gudhi (flag). It is believed
%    that this festival is celebrated to commemorate the coronation of Rama
%    post his return to Ayodhya after completing 14 years of exile.

% --    Maharashtrians also see the Gudhi as a symbol of victory
%     associated with the conquests of the Maratha forces led by
%     Chhatrapati Shivaji. It also symbolizes the victory of King
%     Shalivahana over Sakas and was hoisted by his people when he
%     returned to Paithan. Gudhi is believed to ward off evil, invite
%     prosperity and good luck into the house.
